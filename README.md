### Additional Notes

- The `rain_fall.py` file contains the main raindrop simulation.
- The `snow_fall.py` file contains the snowflake simulation.
- Adjust constants like `FPS`, `WIDTH`, and `HEIGHT` in the code to customize the simulation.
- Explore and modify the `RainDrop`, `Rain`, `Snowflake`, and `main` classes to experiment with different effects and behaviors.
